- 👋 Hi, I’m the real @BriceNeilson.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning absolutely everything Elon Musk hasn't even thought of.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning not much... As it turns out, Musk is somewhat of a really smart guy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing anything open-source that makes the world even just a little safer, happier, or kinder.
- 📫 How to reach me @briceneilson on Twitter or /briceneilson on LinkedIn.
